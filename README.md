Overview:

This package contains the implemention of algorithm MSSTN.

To run the code, please dowload dataset from  [BaiDuYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1UDcgcnekgs61envs2sjWRA) password: 4by5 or [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iXBK89_ER5cC8GrrZVk3VXu4rdlNPUpz/view?usp=sharing) 

To run the code, one can change the parameter "DATASET" to specify command line arguements (e.g. python train.py --dataset=NPEMS04 --lr=0.01), and run the Python file 'train.py'. 
To modify the default hyperparameters you need to change the parameters in 'options.py'.
There are different versions of MSSTN models in the models directory, please select the corresponding version according to your needs, please specify it in 'train.py'.
  
The code is associated with the following paper: 
Yun Song, Xinke Bai, Fan Wendong, Deng Zelin, Cong Jiang, "MSSTN: A Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Network for Traffic Flow Prediction," 
   
Please cite this paper if you use this code.
